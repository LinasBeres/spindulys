Spindulys
======

## Introduction

A simple and light weight ray tracer.

You want to quickly want to trace a scene then this project is for you!

## Installation

At this current moment in time you can only build it from source, done by,

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### Requirements

These are the current packages needed to build Spindulys:
- clang
- [Intel Embree](https://github.com/embree/embree) (3.5.2)
- [USD](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD) (20.11)
- [TBB](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB) (2018.U6)

In the future these dependancies should either be minimised or completely removed.

### Running
Currently only USD scenes are supported. Launch one by,
```
spindulys -s <path/to/usdScene>
```

Then move the camera around with the WASD keys and right mouse button to rotate.

## Acknowledgements
This was orignally forked from https://github.com/JoshuaSenouf/tracer into https://github.com/LinasBeres/tracer, but then as I made more changes I decided to turn it into it's own repository.
