 * received by a given surface location. Mitsuba uses this approach in a wider
 * bidirectional sense: sampling the incident importance due to a sensor also
 * uses the same data structures and strategies, which are referred to as
 * <em>direct sampling</em>.
 *
 * This record inherits all fields from \ref PositionSample and extends it with
 * two useful quantities that are cached so that they don't need to be
 * recomputed: the unit direction and distance from the reference position to
 * the sampled point.
